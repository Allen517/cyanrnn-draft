Modeling the generation process of cascade has important implications for
understanding information propagation and launching viral marketing.
Majority of previous works focus on interpersonal influence modeling based on
diffusion models, limited by model bias and requirement of hidden diffusion
networks. Although traditional sequence modeling has no limitation on hidden
diffusion network, such modeling method can hardly exploit complex dependence
and propagation patterns. Therefore we apply RNN in cascade dynamics modeling.
We propose attenion-based RNN to solve crossing dependency problem, caused
by tree-structured propagations. Furthermore, we propose coverage in
attention-based RNN, leading the alignments focused more on recent propagations.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in
multiple prediction tasks and propagation structure inference.
